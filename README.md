This repository stores programming codes for three tumor data analyses, described in the paper entitled. "A framework for analysis and modeling of the collateral mutations in human skin cancers" Bakhyt Matkarimov, Konstantin Gunbin, Zamart Ramazanova, Murat Saparbaev, Sergey Nikolaev, and Andrey Yurchenko.

(1) The "distantPatterns" and "distantPatternsKG" directories contain alternative programming codes for the "Enrichment of mutations near putative error-free bypassed DNA lesions" paper subsection in Materials and Methods section.

(2) The "observedVSexpected" directory contains programming codes for the "Sample-unspecific strategy of permutation (across all samples in dataset)" paper subsection in Materials and Methods section.

(3) The "sameReadMutVSdifferentReadsMut" directory contains programming codes for the "Analysis of the clustered mutations located on the same reads" paper subsection in Materials and Methods section.
