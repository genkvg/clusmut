The analysis consists of 7 steps. To perform analysis, the user should prepare filtered VCF files using the alignability map of the human genome from the UCSC browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeMapability) with the length of K-mer equal to 75â€‰bp (wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign75mer).

Follow the dependency instructions and comments in each Perl script to execute analysis steps.

Step 0: selecting 'PASS' SNP variants and filtering out MNP variants from VCF files

Step 1: converting VCF files into BED map of mutated positions and FASTA file of mutated trinucleotides

Step 2: preparing a TSV file for subsequent analyses

Step 3: producing a table that contains the numbers of two observed clustered trinucleotide mutated patterns and the distances between them

Step 4: randomizing (via random permutation) tumor labels for mutated trinucleotide patterns

Step 5: summarizing observed clustered trinucleotide mutated patterns and the distances between them by IUPAC consensus sets

Step 6: summarizing expected (permuted) clustered trinucleotide mutated patterns and the distances between them by IUPAC consensus sets
